# 🍽️ Food Image Preprocessing - NutriBot AI Team

This repo contains preprocessing tools for the **Food Image Classifier** used in NutriBot.  
Our goal is to prepare clean, augmented, and well-structured datasets for training deep learning models.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Preprocess single images (`preprocess_food_images.py`)
- ✅ Batch preprocess folders (`batch_preprocess.py`)
- ✅ Visualize preprocessing (`visualize_preprocessing.py`)
- ✅ Split dataset into train/val/test (`dataset_splitter.py`)
- ✅ Reusable augmentation functions (`utils/augmentations.py`)
